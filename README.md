# OpenIIT_MS_24
## Prerequisites

Before running this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
Python 3.x: Required to run the Jupyter Notebook.
Jupyter Notebook: To open .ipynb files interactively. Install via:

    bash

    pip install notebook

Dependencies: Install all necessary libraries by running:

    bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    (Note: You may need to create a requirements.txt file if one is not included, listing the libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc.)

Open Jupyter Notebook:

Start the Jupyter Notebook server by running:

    bash

        jupyter notebook

        In the Jupyter interface, navigate to the data_openiit_24.ipynb file and open it.

Run Each Cell Sequentially:
The notebook is divided into cells, each performing a specific operation.
To run a cell, select it and press Shift + Enter or use the "Run" button.
Follow any specific instructions within the notebook.

## Data Loading:
Use the data files present in the directory, which will be processed in the jupyter notebook.

## Data Preprocessing:
Here, data is cleaned and transformed to prepare it for analysis or modeling.
1. Import Libraries and Load Data
The required libraries (such as pandas) are imported, and the dataset is loaded into a DataFrame. This data includes columns for departure, arrival, and delay times.

2. Data Cleaning
   Removed irrelevant columns that won’t contribute to the analysis.
   Handled missing values, by imputation and removing rows/columns.

   Converted Date-Time Columns
   Converted date-time information to a standardized format for both departure and arrival times. This step ensures consistency and enables easier time-based calculations.

3. Calculate Delay Metrics
   Computed delays by subtracting scheduled times from actual times for both departures and arrivals.
   Added a new column for departure delay and arrival delay to quantify the difference in minutes.

4. Feature Engineering: One-Hot Encoding
   Performed one-hot encoding on categorical columns, such as ‘From’ and ‘To’ (origin and destination) and ‘Airline.’
   This converts categorical data into numerical format, making it suitable for model input.

5. Extract Month from Date
   Converted the ‘Used Date’ column to a datetime format.
   Extracted the month from ‘Used Date’ to create a new ‘Month’ feature for possible seasonal trend analysis.

6. Output Verification
   Displayed the first few rows of the DataFrame at each step to ensure transformations are correct and inspect new columns added.

## Analysis:
This section includes statistical analyses, data visualizations, or other explorations.

## Modeling:
If applicable, this section may build and train machine learning models on the processed data.

## Results:
Displays the outcomes of the analyses or models, often with visualizations or summaries.

## Troubleshooting:

ModuleNotFoundError: If you encounter an error saying a module is not found, make sure you have installed all dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Data File Errors: Ensure that any data files used in the notebook are located in the correct directory, and that file paths in the code are correct.
